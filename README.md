# Nonsense Hardcore

A PaperMC plugin

When you die, the server stops, deletes the world, and downloads random datapacks from Modrinth for your next playthrough.

See the plugin's config file for important settings. Use `/nonsensehardcore reset` to manually reset without having to die.

Note: The plugin assumes your world file is named `world`.

This is a derivative of the [Fahare](https://github.com/qixils/fahare) plugin, using most of the boilerplate and some of the functionality. Go check it out!
