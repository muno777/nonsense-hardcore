# Nonsense Hardcore

A Paper plugin where, when you die, the server stops, deletes the world, and downloads
random datapacks from Modrinth for your next playthrough.

See the plugin's config file for important settings. Use `/nonsensehardcore reset` to manually
reset without having to die.

This is a derivative of the [Fahare](https://github.com/qixils/fahare) plugin, using
most of the boilerplate and some of the functionality. Go check it out!
